## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection **
   - Collected ESG, climate, economic, and project-specific data from various sources.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing **
   - Cleaning and preparing data for model training, including handling missing values and feature extraction.

### 3. **Model Loading from Hugging Face(Ongoing)**
   - Load a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for ESG scoring and project evaluation.

### 4. **Training Using Custom Data**
   - Fine-tune the model with custom data to tailor it for specific project evaluation tasks.

### 5. **Fine-Tuning Using QLoRA**
   - Further improve model performance with QLoRA for better accuracy and adaptability.

### 6. **Pushing the Model to Hugging Face (Global AI Community)**
   - Upload the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face for global access and collaboration.

### 7. **Loading the Fine-Tuned Model Locally**
   - Load the fine-tuned model locally for testing and integration.

### 8. **Testing the Fine-Tuned Model**
   - Test the model's performance to ensure accurate ESG scoring and optimization.

### 9. **Deploying in Web**
   - Deploy the model on the web with an interactive dashboard and API for stakeholders.
